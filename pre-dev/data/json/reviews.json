interactive and reflective course highly recommended.","1":"Great introduction to Ableton Live. Covers all stuff you need to know, and helps you through some stumbling blocks.","2":"While there is some interesting content, particuarly in the last week on design thinking, some of the course topics don't seem to hold together well, and the videos include a lot of monotonous talking heads. While this conveys the benefit of being able to listen to some of the videos without consistently watching, the interview questions asked of speakers are sometimes printed on the screen and not asked verbally. If you're not watching, you miss the questions. I would like to see this course refocused on design thinking for 3D printing, with other applications interspersed as examples rather than constituting the lion's share of the course. I believe that format would both be more engaging and do a better job of delivering skills with more opportunity for practice.","3":"Definitely good course for those working in either accounting or analytics. It gave me new ideas on how to apply analytical methods. Interesting examples on how to identify number management and how analytics can help to set up non-financial metrics that drive financial outcomes.","4":"Very helpful in acquiring necessary knowledge about Live. I would recommend this course to several others like me interested to get their hands on Ableton.","5":"An excellent course to start with, if you are completely new to 3D printing. Easy-to-understand language, very little special tech-talk, so the course is suitable for virtually anybody. t is true that you do not need to be a tech genius to get acquanted with the world of 3D printing!","6":"Great introduction to Ableton. If you love music, this can change the way you create sounds, melodies, rhythms,...","7":"It was exactly like the lecturer said it would be like.The only hard part is the last part, where we had to actually remix an existing 3D model .I think this part of the lecturer video should have had an in depth look at how to use the 3D app.Nevertheless the course was good I learnt a lot of new stuff and not to give out any spoilers.....Its worth it.","8":"Fully recommend if you want to dive into Ableton Live","9":"Bushee was fantastic! Ittner was fine, but not as entertaining as Bushee.","10":"2 thumbs up learned something that I have never learnt before.","11":"Excellent introduction of 3D printing. The course is well designed and engaging. Looking forward to the other courses in the series.","12":"As thorough as possible given the time constraints. Erin Barra did a terrific job of condensing the material . I ended up appreciating the appeal of Ableton Live -- which is to say, a non-linear, clip-based DAW. The program (and Push) is endless, and I'm still learning all sorts of things. Good to have this basic foundation to work from. Thanks....!","13":"must have if you want to start using ableton","14":"Great intro to Ableton, with good hands-on experience. Nice starting point for those who seek to expand their music creation toolset.","15":"Perfect Starting point to Ableton Live!!!","16":"Excellent course. Very well presented. I enjoyed not only the instruction sessions but also the interviews with other specialists in this fascinating field. A great course to inspire one to continue pursuing this as a career.","17":"Content very clear and explained by the professors.","18":"Excellent Designed course. Thanks","19":"Perfect Starting point to Ableton Live!!!","20":"I loved! Easy to learn, easy to understand. Now i can to use my Ableton and work on my productions. Very nice teacher!","21":"I bit too complicated, as a lot of material placed within 4 weeks of ~15min videos.","22":"Finally i am able to complete this course. This course was little tougher than the other 3 courses due to some complicated accounting spreadsheet calculations. But i finally i am able to make it. Good Luck to rest of the folks.","23":"I enjoyed the course a lot. I cannot thank the instructors enough.It would have been more interesting if we could go deeper on linear programming, such as extension to integer programming. The discussion about the duality was a bit too fast to me.","24":"This course made me look at Accounting in a very different way; instead of common business schedules, it actually became exciting to read and find out what was really going on!","25":"it's a great course for people who want to learn easily the base of this program!","26":"GREAT!! thanks a lot :) :)","27":"Amazing! Very interactive, engaging and comprehensive.","28":"I believe that it is a fantastic course for those have some basic accounting knowledge and the willingness to enter compliance area. More importantly, the concept linking financial and non-financial decisions are also fantastic to bring accounting to life! I do love both professors in the module!","29":"One of the most useful course on IT Management!","30":"very interesting","31":"A fantastic course","32":"Great content! Learned a lot.","33":"This has been an phenomenal course on the education and worldviews of First Nations people. As an educator in a First Nation's community in Ontario's north, the knowledge in the lectures has been phenomenal.","34":"Geeat it give the confidence to unleash my creativity. And now I see the world with different eyes, with great opportunities to create or customize objects in 3D.","35":"A very nice experience. I expected an entry level course, but Erin organised a well rounded path. I got a new effective approach to the Ableton Live 9 software.I recommend to develop carefully your assignments: you will improve your own skills by comparing your solutions with those of the classmates. In addiction you'll find some \"veteran\" student willing to help.Good luck!","36":"Amazing! Very interactive, engaging and comprehensive.","37":"Very nice introduction about 3D printing! I love it!","38":"Very good course for learning how to work in Ableton. Professor Barra teaches really great.","39":"Good as a introduction, but there was only a few people on blend so it was hard to earn their votes, hope there will apear some intermediate or advanced courses.","40":"a very good overview that makes you long for","41":"Great course","42":"Very relevant and useful course designed for CIOs","43":"Great course! For very short time you'll learn so many amazing things. You will know in depth one professional software for music composition. You'll create 3 compositions which will be placed in musical website and hundreds or thousand of other musicians will hear it and vote for it. You will be part of wonderful group of other musicians like you taking part in the same course. You will be able to discuss with them important subject's... Great course. Thank you, Erin, David!","44":"It should be merged with course 1","45":"great fun and easy to learn.","46":"I bit too complicated, as a lot of material placed within 4 weeks of ~15min videos.","47":"a very good introductory course. as a novice in 3d printing it helped me a lot understanding the basics of 3d printing.","48":"Thank you very much for this awesome course, I really enjoyed and learned alot from it.I really liked the selected topics, they act like an intro to some really interesting fields in the programming.I've learned about NP multiple times but never found a use to it until now, the problems were really good and informative.I think the linear programming was pretty rushed, it should've been expanded over two weeks with more in details.Maybe add a problem or explain the use of duality .","49":"I love the professors, but unfortunately, I do not feel much connection to me (not really seeing so much importance for me to identifying if a company is making fake financial statements; I am not an investor, and my everyday work does not really have so much to do with financial statements).The Managerial Accounting (week 4) transforms my mindset!! I really appreciate that. That one single week of course can literally help so many companies\/NGOs. That week 4 should be promoted more!!","50":"Very good course well presented especially as the topic can be fairly complex.","51":"it's a great introduction to ableton but nothing more","52":"it's awesome for beginners!","53":"Great introduction to Ableton 9 for a newcomers. You'll learn basics, but those that are enough to start create music.","54":"Excellent course! Totally recommended!","55":"A fantastic course","56":"This course made me look at Accounting in a very different way; instead of common business schedules, it actually became exciting to read and find out what was really going on!","57":"Really useful for beginners!!","58":"Very interesting and provocative course.

I love it!","61":"Vote for Pro. Bushee!","62":"Excellent to start learning.","63":"This is an excellent course, especially for someone with near zero knowledge of financial statements and their analysis. The concepts are clearly presented, with interesting details and supporting examples of their use. The inane comments by cartoon characters using poorly simulated accents is only mildly irritating.","64":"Good place to start if you don't know anything about 3D printing.","65":"The Professor is really amazing. He makes every lecuture interesting and easy to understand.","66":"Perfect Starting point to Ableton Live!!!","67":"This is the first English course I have taken.Though at first it was kind of difficulty because of language(especially the terms) and profession knowledge(it is a comprehensive course and I am still learning courses concerned at school)the course is really worth taking. I have learned a lot .and it stimulates my interest in accounting.","68":"The course was very helpful. Thanks a lot to everyone who have made this happen!","69":"Great course with an even greater lecturer who helps ease users into Ableton Live.","70":"This course change me the views on 3D printing and their revolution.","71":"Thank you Ms professor Erin Bara you are the pest","72":"very interactive and reflective course highly recommended.","73":"This was a great course, great implementation and motivation was provided which has definitely increased my enthusiasm and i am really looking forward to other courses to increase my skills.","74":"Very well documented course.Assignments are designed such a way that it stimulates you to think out of box.","75":"I thought this was a great high-level intro to the world of 3D printing.","76":"Thank you for offering this course. It has taught me a lot of things that I hadn't known. I'm interested in Accounting and there were some times I didn't know where I could gain the materials for study.

Nevertheless, it says that it doesn't require any previous experience... But there is actually experience required on financial statements and concepts.","78":"This was very challenging course for me...

There was a clear logic as the professor developed the various ratios.What was missing for me was some in-line quizzes. Not the \u201ctell me what I just told you type\u201d but rather ones that make you think. So, for example, in the final video for Week 1, the optional video, instead of just suggesting that the students \u201cplay\u201d with the spreadsheet, I think it would be better to give them an actual task or two\u2026 \u201cchange the assumption about X to <this value>. What is the impact on the Y ratio? Why?\u201d I liked that he showed what numbers needed to be changed to make the share valuation closer to $55. But rather than just telling us the answer, this would be another opportunity to have the students stop the video and go try it themselves. With a specific task, it is likely that more students will go and work with the spreadsheet. This is where the real learning takes place.One of the things that I really liked about the design of prior courses by Professor Bushee was the fact that he had examples throughout the videos that had you apply the information right away. But, perhaps this is just me. I know that I learn a lot better by doing rather than just watching the videos and going \u201cyeah\u2026 that makes sense. I understand\u2026\u201d I also recognize that some students, in past courses, have probably said they don\u2019t find the in-line quizzes valuable. But, is that a reflection of the value of in-line quizzes as a whole or just in-line quizzes that simply require \u201cparroting\u201d something said in the video.I\u2019m sure that the professor can come up with lots of examples. In Week 1 Video 1 the in-line quiz might provide some numbers for De-levered Net Income, Sales, Average Total Assets and Average Shareholder\u2019s Equity and asking for the results of each of the ratios in the Dupont Analysis. And maybe a \u201cthink about what this means\u201d type question that is not necessarily \u201cmarked\u201d but for which an answer is provided in the video. Alternatively, he could have the students change some specific things in the Woof Junction spreadsheet and indicate what impact that has on the ratios and why.Week 1 Video 2 offers lots of similar opportunities with the Profitability and Turnover Ratios. Perhaps requiring the students to work backwards from a specific ratio to determine gross profit would be effective. Or, perhaps a question that relates strategy specifically to the ratios. For example, what would happen to the Gross Margin if Woof introduced a credit card and days receivable increased to 31.6 in 2015? Just something to engage people with the materials.All of the videos offer similar opportunities and I think having specific problems or questions will enhance the learning experience rather than just suggesting that they \u201cgo look at the spreadsheet\u201d. The audience for these courses tends to be quite a bit different from your average upper tier university student and probably needs a bit more \u201chand holding\u201d and \u201cdirection\u201d in order to be successful.Also, if Professor Bushee expects students will watch the optional videos anyway, why make them optional? In the case of the Valuation Video, despite some of the mathematics being a little \u201cscary\u201d for some students, I think that the information there is really useful and helps to solidify an understanding of the spreadsheet.I\u2019m wondering if an in-quiz question would be helpful. Perhaps it might provide a new set of financials for Woof Junction and ask for ratio calculation and what that means in terms of their position in the marketplace or something similar. Just some practice questions to get people working with the information.Same comments basically apply for the remainder of the weeks. I think that it would help the students to have some in-line quizzes \u2013 this not only breaks up the longer videos and helps to keep students focused but also provides a reinforcement of key concepts.I really liked the quiz for Week 1 even though I struggled with the questions where there are multiple correct responses. The quiz effectively reinforces the information covered very well and requires one to think about what was covered in the lectures.You may want to remind students that the questions may change from quiz to quiz. In many of these on-demand courses, the quiz questions do not change and students may be in the habit of not rereading the questions they have gotten correct on previous attempts.Week 2 \u2013 Revenue After Cash Collection at 7:39 \u2013 talking about Days Unearned Revenue and mentions that an \u201cincrease means slower future recognition\u201d. A bit more explanation around what that means would be useful.Week 3 \u2013 no particular additional comments on the lectures other than some in-line questions might be good.. I found Benford\u2019s Law really interesting.Week 4. It would be really nice to have something to break up the lectures \u2013 some in-line quiz questions might help. This would also help to reinforce the material.Week 4 quiz Question 9 -, the double negative wording of the question and the correct response may cause confusion for students \u2013 particularly for those for whom English is not their native language.Overall CommentsI enjoyed the course and learned a lot. I was wondering whether it would be possible to provide a summary document with all the key information from each week related to the ratio calculations and the key things to look for related to those ratios. I know that the ratios are provided in the spreadsheet but it might be good to have a written summary with some supplemental information about how to use the ratios.I think in-line quizzes or practice questions would be helpful for students \u2013 perhaps ones that asked students to do specific things in the spreadsheet and come back with an answer. They don\u2019t need to be long or complicated \u2013 just something that gets people into the spreadsheets and working with them early. You may want to do something stronger to encourage them to \u201cplay\u201d with the spreadsheet. Many will feel reluctant to change the numbers in the spreadsheet for fear of \u201cmessing\u201d it up. Perhaps a reminder that they can change whatever they want because if they mess something up they can always download it again. Or they can save a copy and play in that leaving the original untouched.It also might be a good idea to have a \u201cplayground\u201d sheet where there is a simple set of Financial Statements and the students can try changing things in the financial statements and see the impact on the key ratios without having to move from one spreadsheet to another \u2013 so, a combination of the Original tab and the first two columns of the Ratios tab. You might even want to have two columns for the ratios \u2013 one for the ratios with the original numbers that does not change (fixed values) and one for the changed numbers, so students can see the effect of the changes easily.In terms of the spreadsheets, I thought that the Original, the Ratios and the CommonSize tabs were fairly straight forward and relatively easy to understand. That may not be the case for people less familiar with MS-EXCEL but I don\u2019t know what the target audience is for this course so the students may all be proficient with the tool. On the Valuation tab, I was wondering if the numbers in Row 41 should be highlighted in some way to emphasize that they are Years. That is not clear on first glance.There are a lot of mistakes in the subtitles. I pointed out many of these by flagging the specific videos where they occurred.Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the beta-test of this course.

Thank you Prof. Bushee!","240":"I did not understand the submitting process till the fourth week. I feel that you could have offered a more detailed description . Doing the review in the fourth week did not do justice for my peers.","241":"Amazing Course!","242":"Topics related to the economy or business are not something I am good at or enjoy reading about, this course helped me learn a bunch of useful things I would otherwise not have put effort into studying.","243":"This is my feedback as a Beta-Tester for the course:Week 1I thought that the videos were clear, well organized and flowed well from topic to topic. There was a clear logic as the professor developed the various ratios.What was missing for me was some in-line quizzes. Not the \u201ctell me what I just told you type\u201d but rather ones that make you think. So, for example, in the final video for Week 1, the optional video, instead of just suggesting that the students \u201cplay\u201d with the spreadsheet, I think it would be better to give them an actual task or two\u2026 \u201cchange the assumption about X to <this value>. What is the impact on the Y ratio? Why?\u201d I liked that he showed what numbers needed to be changed to make the share valuation closer to $55. But rather than just telling us the answer, this would be another opportunity to have the students stop the video and go try it themselves. With a specific task, it is likely that more students will go and work with the spreadsheet. This is where the real learning takes place.One of the things that I really liked about the design of prior courses by Professor Bushee was the fact that he had examples throughout the videos that had you apply the information right away. But, perhaps this is just me. I know that I learn a lot better by doing rather than just watching the videos and going \u201cyeah\u2026 that makes sense. I understand\u2026\u201d I also recognize that some students, in past courses, have probably said they don\u2019t find the in-line quizzes valuable. But, is that a reflection of the value of in-line quizzes as a whole or just in-line quizzes that simply require \u201cparroting\u201d something said in the video.I\u2019m sure that the professor can come up with lots of examples. In Week 1 Video 1 the in-line quiz might provide some numbers for De-levered Net Income, Sales, Average Total Assets and Average Shareholder\u2019s Equity and asking for the results of each of the ratios in the Dupont Analysis. And maybe a \u201cthink about what this means\u201d type question that is not necessarily \u201cmarked\u201d but for which an answer is provided in the video. Alternatively, he could have the students change some specific things in the Woof Junction spreadsheet and indicate what impact that has on the ratios and why.Week 1 Video 2 offers lots of similar opportunities with the Profitability and Turnover Ratios. Perhaps requiring the students to work backwards from a specific ratio to determine gross profit would be effective. Or, perhaps a question that relates strategy specifically to the ratios. For example, what would happen to the Gross Margin if Woof introduced a credit card and days receivable increased to 31.6 in 2015? Just something to engage people with the materials.All of the videos offer similar opportunities and I think having specific problems or questions will enhance the learning experience rather than just suggesting that they \u201cgo look at the spreadsheet\u201d. The audience for these courses tends to be quite a bit different from your average upper tier university student and probably needs a bit more \u201chand holding\u201d and \u201cdirection\u201d in order to be successful.Also, if Professor Bushee expects students will watch the optional videos anyway, why make them optional? In the case of the Valuation Video, despite some of the mathematics being a little \u201cscary\u201d for some students, I think that the information there is really useful and helps to solidify an understanding of the spreadsheet.I\u2019m wondering if an in-quiz question would be helpful. Perhaps it might provide a new set of financials for Woof Junction and ask for ratio calculation and what that means in terms of their position in the marketplace or something similar. Just some practice questions to get people working with the information.Same comments basically apply for the remainder of the weeks. I think that it would help the students to have some in-line quizzes \u2013 this not only breaks up the longer videos and helps to keep students focused but also provides a reinforcement of key concepts.I really liked the quiz for Week 1 even though I struggled with the questions where there are multiple correct responses. The quiz effectively reinforces the information covered very well and requires one to think about what was covered in the lectures.You may want to remind students that the questions may change from quiz to quiz. In many of these on-demand courses, the quiz questions do not change and students may be in the habit of not rereading the questions they have gotten correct on previous attempts.Week 2 \u2013 Revenue After Cash Collection at 7:39 \u2013 talking about Days Unearned Revenue and mentions that an \u201cincrease means slower future recognition\u201d. A bit more explanation around what that means would be useful.Week 3 \u2013 no particular additional comments on the lectures other than some in-line questions might be good.. I found Benford\u2019s Law really interesting.Week 4. It would be really nice to have something to break up the lectures \u2013 some in-line quiz questions might help. This would also help to reinforce the material.Week 4 quiz Question 9 -, the double negative wording of the question and the correct response may cause confusion for students \u2013 particularly for those for whom English is not their native language.Overall CommentsI enjoyed the course and learned a lot. I was wondering whether it would be possible to provide a summary document with all the key information from each week related to the ratio calculations and the key things to look for related to those ratios. I know that the ratios are provided in the spreadsheet but it might be good to have a written summary with some supplemental information about how to use the ratios.I think in-line quizzes or practice questions would be helpful for students \u2013 perhaps ones that asked students to do specific things in the spreadsheet and come back with an answer. They don\u2019t need to be long or complicated \u2013 just something that gets people into the spreadsheets and working with them early. You may want to do something stronger to encourage them to \u201cplay\u201d with the spreadsheet. Many will feel reluctant to change the numbers in the spreadsheet for fear of \u201cmessing\u201d it up. Perhaps a reminder that they can change whatever they want because if they mess something up they can always download it again. Or they can save a copy and play in that leaving the original untouched.It also might be a good idea to have a \u201cplayground\u201d sheet where there is a simple set of Financial Statements and the students can try changing things in the financial statements and see the impact on the key ratios without having to move from one spreadsheet to another \u2013 so, a combination of the Original tab and the first two columns of the Ratios tab. You might even want to have two columns for the ratios \u2013 one for the ratios with the original numbers that does not change (fixed values) and one for the changed numbers, so students can see the effect of the changes easily.In terms of the spreadsheets, I thought that the Original, the Ratios and the CommonSize tabs were fairly straight forward and relatively easy to understand. That may not be the case for people less familiar with MS-EXCEL but I don\u2019t know what the target audience is for this course so the students may all be proficient with the tool. On the Valuation tab, I was wondering if the numbers in Row 41 should be highlighted in some way to emphasize that they are Years. That is not clear on first glance.There are a lot of mistakes in the subtitles. I pointed out many of these by flagging the specific videos where they occurred.Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the beta-test of this course. I hope that my comments are helpful and that I have not missed too much that causes students issues as the course goes live.","244":"It opened up my understanding of what could be accomplished with 3D printing","245":"Very good introduction to the subject, instructor never looses the attention with new topics and examples.","246":"The MOOC teaches what it is supposed to, although more classes would be nice since Ableton is such a big program.","247":"Extremely useful!

Of the 4 weeks of the course, I'd say that only week 4 was valid from an internal perspective but it was kept very high level. I'd say this course could be good for a specialization in business market analysis, but not as advertised.I also found the cartoon classroom questions to be very annoying, almost as bad as fingernails on a blackboard.","277":"While I enjoyed this course and the topics covered, I don't feel like the course content matched what the course description stated it was supposed to.

Sadly, his presentation was only 25% of the course. Professor Ittner was very direct but also was very engaging in how he delivered his content. I had a good feeling that I could really understand the material he was teaching. If I could give a rating for just Professor Ittner, I would give a 5 star rating. Now, this is why I am giving this course a 1 star rating. But I do have to say, going into the depths of Accounting Analytics is not easy. You really need to have a good grasp of Accounting otherwise you will get lost. Professor Bushee did not make the first 3 weeks really easy to get through. While I enjoyed his examples & case studies, he simply did not do a great job of really explaining and illustrating the concepts he was teaching. And worst of all, he setup a digitally generated classroom where he had his computer generated students ask pointless questions, make pointless statements, or answer with pointless statements\/answers. I really wish I had the time to analyze how much of the course time he spent doing this, I would estimate that it's around 10% but it could very well be higher. There are so many different examples to pick form, but I'll just pick a few here. \"I didn't read the Iliad or Odyssey some I'm not going to ask you to\" in reference why in regression there are Greek letter used for coefficients (it's a fair assumption that someone taking this class understands coefficients), a 30 second exchange where a PC generate student says that they're \"stocked\" to run some regression followed by Proffessor Bushee informing us that \"we're going to run some narly regressions\", Professor Bushee saying he doesn't know how to perform Earning Management Analysis on Mars but he certainly knows how to do it on Earth, and a joke why people don't like accountants. These segments add absolutely zero value. They lengthen the time of the course. To make maters worse, I'm sure Proffessor Bushee had to spend even more time creating this additional interaction together.","301":"poor course. never give any algorithm.

It does not teach you but just excitedly shows commonly known facts.There are better ways to invest your time.","407":"Great course. Won't say anything else... if you want to know how it is you must try it!","408":"The first three weeks focussed heavily on ratios and detecting fraud and earnings management in an organization, the fourth week seemed to actually relate to data analytics and how non-financial aspects of a company play a role in the financial outcomes. I really do not see where a data analyst who is not in accounting field would be using the fraud detection scenarios in real life. A data analyst would be focused on improving the business and doing the analyses that pertain to improving certain aspects of a business, not finding his manager's earnings management using an M-score etc.","409":"very interesting","410":"Good overview on Financial Analytics!","411":"The Best Course in Accounting Analytics.","412":"Do not hesitate to enroll, it's a brain storming course & I like the way of the teaching here!","413":"While each of the Business Analytics courses have been terrific in their own way, Accounting Analytics was the most challenging and most enjoyable. Accounting + clear information + dogs + sense of fun = a great course. Thank you!","414":"While I enjoyed this course and the topics covered, I don't feel like the course content matched what the course description stated it was supposed to. I enrolled in the Business Analytics Specialization course with a focus on analyzing a business from the inside, not outside. Of the 4 weeks of the course, I'd say that only week 4 was valid from an internal perspective but it was kept very high level. I'd say this course could be good for a specialization in business market analysis, but not as advertised.I also found the cartoon classroom questions to be very annoying, almost as bad as fingernails on a blackboard.","415":"Challenging course, a mixture of forensic and investigation method in accounting","416":"Offers a nice introduction to Ableton and its Usage. However it would have been lovely if this was a longer course.. Loved the way of instructions and the topics covered.","417":"Don't recommend.You're better off skimming through the ableton manual and using the search function to get the answers you want.","418":"My major is accounting but I still felt that it was so difficult. But I learned some knowlege which our teachers didn't tell me. Thanks!","419":"As an introduction course its very helpful. It has just what you need to get started.","420":"Rather robust material with strong focus on \"deceptive\" practice detection. A lot of ratio analyses, each with its own moniker which I found tedious. Informative and confirmed that I don't have the \"accountant gene\".","421":"Thanks for your help.","422":"Extremely useful, powerful and course","423":"Good introductory course, just a little bit to short for my like.Gus","424":"Very well done! Contents, delivery, clarity, everything was top notch. Thank you!","425":"I did not understand the submitting process till the fourth week. I feel that you could have offered a more detailed description . Doing the review in the fourth week did not do justice for my peers.","426":"The three first weeks were almost completely dedicated to traditional finance accounting ratio analysis.","427":"While there is some interesting content, particuarly in the last week on design thinking, some of the course topics don't seem to hold together well, and the videos include a lot of monotonous talking heads. While this conveys the benefit of being able to listen to some of the videos without consistently watching, the interview questions asked of speakers are sometimes printed on the screen and not asked verbally. If you're not watching, you miss the questions. I would like to see this course refocused on design thinking for 3D printing, with other applications interspersed as examples rather than constituting the lion's share of the course. I believe that format would both be more engaging and do a better job of delivering skills with more opportunity for practice.","428":"Inadequate student and teacher participation on forums, leaving students to figure things out without assistance or collaboration. Insufficient explanation of math concepts required to fully understand lectures.","429":"it's a great course for people who want to learn easily the base of this program!","430":"","431":"","432":""}}
